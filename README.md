# Book-Store-Django-Docker

## This is a respository of my Book Store

#### Go check the page! -> https://booksfrancofgp.herokuapp.com/

#### NOTE: in production the STRIPE payment system is not working, because the country where i live is not available in STRIPE, 
and for that reason i cannot fill the form to have live keys, but the LocalRepository is working with the Test Keys

To execute with docker use:

`<docker-compose up -d --build>`
